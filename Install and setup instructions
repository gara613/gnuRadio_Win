This is mainly a reproduction of the install instructions given by Zac Manchester and consignated in:
https://github.com/zacinaction/kicksat/wiki/Installing-GNURadio-(Windows)

# 1. Download GNU Radio
The first step is to download a copy of the installer, nowadays it's a simple task, just pick the link: 
http://www.gcndevelopment.com/gnuradio/downloads.htm, and for further information see: 
http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/InstallingGR

# 2. Install to the default path
As with any other windows program just click and pray.

# 3. No additional Python packages anymore
With the bundle installer you should not need the installation of single packages anymore, if you have any other Python
distribution such as Anaconda you can install any package you want to experiment with yourself.

# 4. Configure PATH 
If you intend to only run GNUradio companion you are ready to go! (Not completely true, GRC at this step is only useful as a 
simulator, when you want to use external input and oputput devices you should configure them properly).
Instead if you want to create, modify, test, and do the fun stuff with blocks and code, you need to configure GNURadio to run
from Python scripts

This part is almost copied textually from Zac's tutorial:
The last thing you have to do is add GNURadio's libraries to your system PATH and PYTHONPATH. 
Open the control panel and navigate to "System Properties". Under the "Advanced" tab, click the "Environment Variables" button.
Under "System variables", click "New" and add a variable called "PYTHONPATH" with the values: 
'C:\Program Files\GNURadio-3.7\lib\site-packages'
Also in the PATH variable add the value: 
'C:\Program Files\GNURadio-3.7\bin'
Also, create the variable: 'GRC_BLOCKS_PATH', with the value: 'C:\Program Files\GNURadio-3.7\share\gnuradio\grc\blocks'
If you, as in my case, use Anacona for other things, probably will see that there is a User Variable called PATH, with the
Anaconda related values, left this untouched as this would not affect the gnuRadio functionality, unless you know what you 
are doing.

# 5. Executing GNURadio from the command line
Now, you are ready to begin. Assuming you read the tutorial: 
http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/Guided_Tutorial_GNU_Radio_in_Python 
and create the file 'if_else.py', you want to run it, there are two options: 1. from the gnuradio command prompt installed with 
gnuradio (easier), 2. from the windows command line (lengthier).

The first thing after you open the command prompt is to open a Python command prompt, just type 'python' and the python 
executable willl be invoked.
If you did from the gnuRadio command prompt there should be no problem invoking the correct version of python, from the windows
command line just be sure of the python path before executing the command. Just to be sure use: 

'''
import sys
sys.executable
after that, change the python current working directory to your preferred location, an alternative is:
import os
os.chdir("MypreferredWorkingFolder")
cwd=os.getcwd()
os.listdir(cwd)
#After veifying your files are in place just have fun!
execfile("MyFile.py")
'''

# 6. Modify the file ExternalEditor.py using the solution posted by https://github.com/skoslowski in:
https://github.com/skoslowski/gnuradio/commit/0002525abeff6f80e7deb35849f2fc47ce9982a4

# 7. If you intend to use RTL-SDR dongles, then reinstall the drivers according to the instructions in:
